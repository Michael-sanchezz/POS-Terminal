Write a cash register or self-service terminal for some kind of retail location.
Obvious choices include a small store, a coffee shop, or a fast food restaurant.
Your solution must include some kind of a product class with a name, category, description, and price for each item. 
12 items minimum; they must be stored in some kind of collection, such as a list.
Present a menu to the user and let them choose an item (by number or letter).
Allow the user to choose a quantity for the item ordered.
Give the user a line total (item price * quantity).
Either through the menu or a separate question, allow them to re-display the menu and to complete the purchase.
Give the subtotal, sales tax, and grand total. (Consider rounding issues)
Ask for payment type—cash, credit, or check
For cash, ask for an amount tendered and provide change.
For check, get the check number.
For credit, get the credit card number, expiration, and CVV.
At the end, display a receipt with all items ordered, subtotal, grand total, and appropriate payment info.
Return to the original menu for a new order. (Hint: you’ll want a list or other collection to keep track of what’s been ordered!)
